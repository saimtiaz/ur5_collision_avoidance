# ur5_collision_avoidance

## Introduction

End-to-end collision avoidance project for the UR5. Utilizes CollisionIK and a RealSense D435 Camera to detect and avoid obstacles. This project includes everything from calibration, point cloud processing, object detection, UR5 movement, and collision avoidance.


## Installation Instructions

## General Tasks

### UR5 IP Address

### Turning on the camera

## Calibration

## Point Cloud Scan

## Point Cloud Cluster Extraction

## Cluster to Collision Object Extraction

## Robot Movement with CollisionIK

1. To use the keyboard controller, please ensure that the termainal window where <keyboard_ikgoal_driver.py> was run from has focus (i.e., make sure it's clicked), then use the following keystrokes:
```bash
    c - kill the controller controller script
    w - move chain 1 along +X
    x - move chain 1 along -X
    a - move chain 1 along +Y
    d - move chain 1 along -Y
    q - move chain 1 along +Z
    z - move chain 1 along -Z
    1 - rotate chain 1 around +X
    2 - rotate chain 1 around -X
    3 - rotate chain 1 around +Y
    4 - rotate chain 1 around -Y
    5 - rotate chain 1 around +Z
    6 rotate chain 1 around -Z

    i - move chain 2 along +X
    m - move chain 2 along -X
    j - move chain 2 along +Y
    l - move chain 2 along -Y
    u - move chain 2 along +Z
    n - move chain 2 along -Z
    = - rotate chain 2 around +X
    - - rotate chain 2 around -X
    0 - rotate chain 2 around +Y
    9 - rotate chain 2 around -Y
    8 - rotate chain 2 around +Z
    7 - rotate chain 2 around -Z
    ```
